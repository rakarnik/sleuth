\description{
Extract bootstrap for a specific transcript.
CURRENTLY DEPRECATED: Will probably be re implemented in the next version.
Currently not working because of a complete rewrite of the bootstrap code.
If you are interested in getting the bootstraps, you can manually write some code
using `read_kallisto()`. Please make sure to comment in the user group if you are using this function.
